# 3D Printed Cases

<br>

i have created stl files to 3d print cases for the following board.

## Pico-W

<a href=https://github.com/stooged/Pico-Server-900/tree/main/3D_Printed_Cases/PicoW>PicoW</a><br>


<br>

the case can be printed in PLA without supports.

<br>

if you wish to edit the case you can import the `.stl` files into <a href=https://www.tinkercad.com/>Tinkercad<a/> and edit them to suit your needs.
